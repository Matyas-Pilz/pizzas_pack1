 green_leaves (not used), ham, cheese, ketchup, mozarella, salami, spinach
 
I know that textures of pizza ingredients are not so good but it is start. I am not food painter...

License:
 Palette in pizzas is under the CC0. Code of both mods is under the MIT License.
 All other textures (and too model in main pizzas) are under the CC-BY 4.0.

File "crafting.lua" isn't actually used and is empty because crafting will be added in the future.

Actually isn't supported baking and eating of pizzas, cakes or other circle food. It could be in future. Planned is too "bake level tool".

Creating own pizzas are simple: download both pizzas and pizzas_pack1, copy and edit texture in pizzas_pack1, edit file "pizzas.lua" in pizzas_pack1 and save it.
 It is very simple :)
 When do you want to share your pizzas as mod, please, do not it as pull request but:
 create it as your own mod pizzas_* and to end of your pizzas names add your name/initials (for not duplication of pizza name).
